			<h3> Noos Island History</h3>
				<p> 
					-REDACTED-
				</p>
				<p class ="redacted"> Noos Island, Ontario, is home to 1.6 million citizens born between February 29, 1940 and February 30, 1940 during what is known as the New Richmond Accident of 1978. 
					<br> 
					<br>
					In 1940, a small team of Canadian scientists, studying gravitational fluctuations near Newfoundland under the guise of supporting Project Manhattan, the New Richmond Team for Anomaly Research discovered what they believed to be a time-exempt island, a small fraction of land caught between parallel universes. Historigraphies differ on the origin of said island -- some believe it to be the result of a experimental failure caused by Universe C-89, while others believe it to be simply an "accident". 
					<br>
					<br>
					No matter the issue, the NRTAR visited the island twice, during their initial contact with the island. They visited it once, on February 29, 1940, at 7:06 EST, and found an uninhabited island, with no vegetation or life. The topsoil was pure carbon. The second time the NRTAR visited the island, on March 1, 1940, at 7:07 EST, they found a lighthouse, an elementary school, a general store, and 1. 6 million inhabitants. 
					<br>
					<br>
					However, the prescence of a purple-smelling fog hindered their attempts to make contact with the inhabitants, and after reporting their findings, the island was quickly put under close government surveillance. In the 78 years since then, the inhabitants have grown by roughly 10 years.
